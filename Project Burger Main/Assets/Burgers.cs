//Time the burgers. Flip them and store them
public class Burgers : MonoBehaviour {

    //make points at which burgers can be place, drag and drop snapping points.

    //every point should have a timer at which starts depending on what burger spawns on it.
    
    //the timer dictates when the burger is complete, (raw, medium, brick).

    //make a place on the side of the grill where the player can place the burgers that were on the grill.
    //when take off it stores its cooking value if the player decides to take it back on the grill.







    //question how to flip,  skill based flip? if they drop it they need to make a new one?
    //make a path at which the player have to swipe in order to turn it, circular motion?

    //just make a circular motion then the burger flips itself?


    //ask about pallet
