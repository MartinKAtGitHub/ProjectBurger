* Grill Questions.

    1. it doesnt look that good with a clock. it could add another layer to the grill by having it but currently the feeling of having it on every burger isnt visualy pleesing.
    2. the clock/temperature is build in to the grill. so that there is a display showing the time/temperatures or something of that sort.

    3. This Is Having An Object That Is Dragged And Put Onto The burger To Show The Temperature, This Could Add An Extra Layer To The Grill System Making It Possible To Make The "Regular Cusomer" As 
       For The Perfect Burger That Is "Raw But 5 Degrees More (Where Raw Is 25 Degrees)"
       For This Option We Still Have The Visual Queues To When The Burger Is Rdy But For Special Orders We Can Use This Devise. This Devise Could Simply Be A Timer Or A Temperature Measurement Device
       
    4. the final option is that there is no timers and its only left to visual queues, when the burger gets a red-ish tint to its color then its done, if its brown-ish its burnt.

    summary: currently the grill system have some visual clutter. the intention of them is good but the visual feeling feels messy, when there is 8 burgers cooking at the same time.
